# Roadmap: BJJ Technique Tracker

## Overview

This roadmap transforms the BJJ Technique Tracker from a technique library into a complete game plan visualization tool. Phase 1 reworks the flowchart architecture to represent positions and techniques as separate, connected nodes — the core innovation that makes position chains visible. Phase 2 exposes the multi-plan management UI that already exists in the store, enabling users to organize multiple game plans. Phase 3 adds interactive enhancements and export capabilities that make the flowchart a practical training tool.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [ ] **Phase 1: Graph Architecture Rework** - Separate position and technique nodes with type-based styling and sweep chaining
- [ ] **Phase 2: Plan Management UI** - Multi-plan CRUD interface with switching, naming, and organization
- [ ] **Phase 3: Enhanced Interactivity & Export** - Detail views, connection highlighting, and image export

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Graph Architecture Rework
**Goal**: Users can see their game plan as an interactive flowchart where positions and techniques are separate, visually distinct nodes showing how positions chain through sweeps and transitions.
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: GRAPH-01, GRAPH-02, GRAPH-03, GRAPH-04, GRAPH-05, GRAPH-06, GRAPH-07, GRAPH-08, GRAPH-09, INTX-04, INTX-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User sees positions as standalone nodes and techniques as separate connected nodes when viewing their game plan
  2. User can visually distinguish technique types at a glance through color coding (submissions, sweeps, escapes, transitions, passes, takedowns)
  3. User sees submission techniques styled as terminal endpoints with no outgoing arrows
  4. User sees sweeps and transitions creating arrows from the technique node to the resulting position node
  5. User sees all positions with techniques appear as entry points in the flowchart (multiple roots, not forced single start)
  6. User can drag nodes to customize layout and the positions persist across sessions
  7. User can pan and zoom the flowchart canvas to navigate large game plans
  8. User sees technique count badges on position nodes showing how many techniques branch from each position
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 01-01-PLAN.md — Rework graph builder + node components (bipartite nodes, technique pill styling, position badge)
- [ ] 01-02-PLAN.md — FlowchartView integration, color legend, store migration, and visual verification

### Phase 2: Plan Management UI
**Goal**: Users can create, organize, and switch between multiple named game plans with full CRUD capabilities exposed in the UI.
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: PLAN-01, PLAN-02, PLAN-03, PLAN-04, PLAN-05, PLAN-06, PLAN-07, INTX-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can create a new game plan with a custom name from the UI
  2. User can switch between multiple game plans and see the correct flowchart for each
  3. User can rename an existing game plan
  4. User can delete a game plan after confirming their intent
  5. User sees helpful empty state guidance when a new plan has no techniques
  6. User can duplicate an existing game plan as a starting point for variations
  7. User can tag game plans with labels (gi, no-gi, competition) for organization
  8. User can remove individual techniques from the plan via UI controls
**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 02-01-PLAN.md — Extend GamePlan type with tags, add store actions (duplicateGamePlan, addTag, removeTag), install shadcn components
- [ ] 02-02-PLAN.md — Plan selector dropdown with CRUD dialogs (create, rename, delete, duplicate), wired into game plan page
- [ ] 02-03-PLAN.md — Tag editor, technique removal from flowchart and list view, and visual verification

### Phase 3: Enhanced Interactivity & Export
**Goal**: Users can interact with flowchart nodes to view details, see connection highlights, and export their game plan as an image to share.
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: INTX-01, INTX-02, INTX-06, INTX-07, EXPRT-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can click a technique node to view its full details (description, steps, tips, difficulty)
  2. User can click a position node to browse and add more techniques from that position
  3. User sees connected paths highlight when hovering over a technique node or edge
  4. User sees a tooltip with technique name and type when hovering over an edge
  5. User can export the current flowchart as a PNG image to save or share with training partners
**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 03-01-PLAN.md — Hover path highlighting and edge tooltips (LabeledEdge, graph data extension, hover handlers)
- [ ] 03-02-PLAN.md — Click-to-detail panels (TechniqueDetailSheet, PositionBrowserSheet, onNodeClick wiring)
- [ ] 03-03-PLAN.md — PNG export with html-to-image@1.11.11 and full Phase 3 human verification

## Progress

**Execution Order:**
Phases execute in numeric order: 1 → 2 → 3

| Phase | Plans Complete | Status | Completed |
|-------|----------------|--------|-----------|
| 1. Graph Architecture Rework | 0/2 | Planned | - |
| 2. Plan Management UI | 0/3 | Planned | - |
| 3. Enhanced Interactivity & Export | 0/TBD | Not started | - |
