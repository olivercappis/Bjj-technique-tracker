# Requirements: BJJ Technique Tracker

**Defined:** 2026-02-16
**Core Value:** The game plan flowchart must clearly show how a user's selected techniques connect across positions — creating a readable visual map of their jiu-jitsu game.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. All shipped in v1.0.

### Graph Architecture

- [x] **GRAPH-01**: Positions render as standalone nodes in the flowchart (not containers for techniques)
- [x] **GRAPH-02**: Techniques render as separate nodes connected to their source position via directed edges
- [x] **GRAPH-03**: Technique nodes are color-coded by type (submission, sweep, escape, transition, pass, takedown)
- [x] **GRAPH-04**: Submission nodes are styled as distinct "finish" endpoints with no outgoing edges
- [x] **GRAPH-05**: Techniques with `resultingPositionId` have an edge from the technique node to the resulting position node
- [x] **GRAPH-06**: Chained positions display their techniques too — if a sweep leads to mount and user has mount techniques, those appear connected
- [x] **GRAPH-07**: All positions with user-selected techniques appear as entry points (multiple roots in the graph)
- [x] **GRAPH-08**: Graph auto-layouts with Dagre on initial render while preserving user-dragged positions
- [x] **GRAPH-09**: Technique count badges appear on position nodes showing how many techniques branch from each

### Interactivity

- [x] **INTX-01**: User can click a technique node to view its full details (description, steps, tips)
- [x] **INTX-02**: User can click a position node to browse and add techniques from that position
- [x] **INTX-03**: User can remove a technique from the plan via the flowchart or list view
- [x] **INTX-04**: User can drag nodes to rearrange the flowchart layout
- [x] **INTX-05**: User can pan and zoom the flowchart canvas
- [x] **INTX-06**: Hovering a technique node or edge highlights connected paths in the graph
- [x] **INTX-07**: Hovering an edge shows a tooltip with the technique name and type

### Plan Management

- [x] **PLAN-01**: User can create a new game plan with a custom name
- [x] **PLAN-02**: User can switch between multiple game plans
- [x] **PLAN-03**: User can rename an existing game plan
- [x] **PLAN-04**: User can delete a game plan with a confirmation prompt
- [x] **PLAN-05**: User sees an empty state with guidance when a plan has no techniques
- [x] **PLAN-06**: User can duplicate an existing game plan as a starting point for a new one
- [x] **PLAN-07**: User can tag game plans with labels (e.g., gi, no-gi, competition)

### Export

- [x] **EXPRT-01**: User can export the flowchart as a PNG image to share with training partners

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Authentication & Sharing

- **AUTH-01**: User can create an account with email/password
- **AUTH-02**: User game plans persist to a backend database
- **AUTH-03**: User can share game plans with other users via link
- **AUTH-04**: User can view shared game plans from other users

### Advanced Visualization

- **VIZ-01**: User can collapse/expand position nodes to see high-level flow vs detailed techniques
- **VIZ-02**: User can highlight shortest path between two positions
- **VIZ-03**: User can undo/redo changes to game plan
- **VIZ-04**: User can assign custom colors to individual nodes

### Data

- **DATA-01**: Expanded technique library with more positions and techniques
- **DATA-02**: User can submit technique suggestions for library inclusion
- **DATA-03**: Technique data includes video references

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| User accounts / authentication | Future milestone — focus on core flowchart value first |
| Real-time collaboration | Requires backend infrastructure, unclear value for personal tools |
| Mobile native app | Web-first with responsive design is sufficient |
| AI technique recommendations | Presumptuous and skill-level dependent — BJJ is too context-specific |
| Pre-built "best" game plans | Everyone's game is different; misleading |
| Video embedding in flowchart | Visual clutter, performance issues, scope creep |
| Gamification (points, streaks) | Game plans are strategic tools, not games |
| In-app technique creation | Data quality concern — keep library curated |
| Performance/match tracking | Different product category entirely |
